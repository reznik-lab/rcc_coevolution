# rcc_coevolution

This repository contains the code required to reproduce analyses and figure panels presented in XX.

## Data
The data used in the code is available in Zenodo (10.5281/zenodo.8066511). All scripts require the data object "All Data.RData" to be downloaded to be run. The script "Supplementary Figure 2.R" produces a data object called "Outlier Data.RData", which is used in all scripts except "Supplementary Figure 1.R" and "Supplementary Figure 2.R".

## Data Analysis
The code needed to generate the analyses and results used to illustrate each figure panel is in R scripts labelled by figure. Each script can be run individually and does not need to be run in order.
